# l100project
This is a project for the Level 100s, now Level 200s.

The project is to make an application that provides terminologies used in Computer Science, and most likely science in general, along with their definitions.
It is basically a glossary.
Currently looking at a mobile app and a desktop app.
There may be an api to which they connect to to get new words and definitions, but the applications are largely supposed to be able to operate independently of the internet.

1) Find a source for all the words + definitions
2) Find a way to extract the information (Web Scrapping may be needed)
3) Create the mobile app
  3.1) Communicate with the API whenever there is internet connection to get new list of words
4) Create the desktop app
  4.1) Communicate with the API whenever there is internet connection to get new list of words
5) Create the API (If the source we can find is an API already, this won't be needed)
  5.1) Connect API to source of words + definitions
  5.2) Save information into a database
  5.3) Serve information from database to clients that connect to the API
6) Release Mobile and Desktop Applications to the general public

Work In Progress. May be updated.
